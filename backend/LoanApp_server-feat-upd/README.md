# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the **LoanApp** Project! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and contribute to the project. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and follow the **Contributing Guidelines**.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

- **Clone the entire repository** (with all branches):  
   If you want to clone the entire repository, including all branches, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkcsoftwaresllp/LoanApp_server.git
   cd LoanApp_server
   ```
   This will clone the whole repository, and you can switch between branches as needed.

- **Clone only the `development` branch**:  
   If you only want the `development` branch, use this command:
   ```bash
   git clone --single-branch --branch development https://github.com/jkcsoftwaresllp/LoanApp_server.git
   ```

- **Clone specific branches (e.g., `development`, `feature/xyz`, `hotfix/abc`)**:  
   If you want to clone multiple specific branches, first clone the `development` branch and then fetch additional branches:
   ```bash
   git clone --single-branch --branch development https://github.com/jkcsoftwaresllp/LoanApp_server.git
   cd LoanApp_server
   git fetch origin feature/xyz:feature/xyz
   git fetch origin hotfix/abc:hotfix/abc
   ```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
   Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 3. **Create Your Branch**
   Switch your local working branch to a new branch based on the task you are working on.  
   Use the branch naming conventions outlined in the [Contributing Guide](#contributing). Example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/yourname-feature-description
   ```

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**
   Make your changes and commit them using a properly formatted commit message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: short and meaningful description of your changes"
   ```

### 5. **Push to Remote Branch**
   Push your local branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/yourname-feature-description
   ```

### 6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   Generate a PR from your branch to the `development` branch. Use the predefined PR template and ensure you fill in all required sections. Make necessary changes according to review feedback.

## Important Notes

- **Never push directly to the `main` or `development` branches.**  
  Always create and work on your own feature branch.

- **Never create a PR for the `main` branch.**  
  All PRs should target the `development` branch.

- Follow the commit message structure outlined in the [Contributing Guide](#contributing).

- Ensure you test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR.

## Summary of Steps

For your convenience, here is a quick summary of the setup process:

1. Clone the repository (`main` or `development` branch, or specific branches).  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  
3. Create a new branch using the appropriate naming convention.  
4. Commit your changes with a properly formatted message.  
5. Push your branch to the remote repository.  
6. Submit a PR to the `development` branch using the PR template.

At the bottom of this guide, youâ€™ll always find a summarized version of the steps. Refer to this section for quick reference.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Work on a dedicated branch**: Create a branch from `development` for your task. Avoid working directly on `main` or `development`.
2. **Rebase before submitting**: Rebase your branch with the latest `development` branch to resolve conflicts.
3. **Submit a PR**:

   - We have a predefined template for submitting a PR or an issue. Please use it when creating your submission.
   - Target the `development` branch for all PRs.
   - Use a descriptive title and include a summary of changes.
   - Link any relevant issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).

4. **Review and Approvals**:

   - PRs to `development` require approval from **Allowed Team Members or Team Leaders**.
   - PRs to `main` require approval from **Admins or Team Leaders** only.

5. **Merging**:
   - Changes from `development` to `main` can only be merged by **Admins or Team Leaders** after final testing and review.

## Modifying Documentation

- Direct changes to `README.md` are **not allowed**.
- Propose changes by creating a `README.draft.md` or `docs/proposals/<username>_<description>.md` file in your branch.
- Documentation updates will be reviewed and incorporated into `README.md` after approval.
